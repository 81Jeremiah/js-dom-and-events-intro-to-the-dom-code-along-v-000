# Reintroduction to the DOM

## Objectives

1. Explain how DOM nodes are written
2. Describe how to structure the DOM
3. Explain the difference between inline and block elements
4. Explain how to use inline styles

## Outline

We want students to come away from this lesson with a more complete understanding of the DOM than they gained in the earlier lesson in [Unit 5](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/introduction-to-the-dom).

As the objectives show, we mainly want them to have a good feel for the difference between elements that display as blocks by default versus those that are by default inline.

It might be helpful to have students code along (you can use inline styles!) and compare their results to a screenshot of what the webpage should look like (alongside a "solution" branch).
